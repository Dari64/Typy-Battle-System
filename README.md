# Typy-Battle-System
A Typing Point and Click RPG battle system, heavily inspired by Earthbound and Undertale.

Note: If you're interested in game testing, try holding the right arrow key while playing (Yes I know It's quite uncomfortable) to show up all the variables, in case you're trying to deduce bugs. I am also leaving the original Scratch sb3 files, you will need to open it in Turbowrap and set the resolution to 1280x720. Have fun snooping through and working on improving it or anything! Idc if you use this as a base to work on your own inspired something something, just message me and I'll happy to try it out, though I'd appreciate it if you'd credit me as thanks or inspiration if you do.

Please don't double click the stance boxes, again and again, it causes a game-breaking bug. 

An RPG battle system with emphasis on words and actions, inspired by Earthbound and Undertale!

This is a short game I made using SCRATCH 3.0 Desktop.

This is an explanation of how most game functions work:

IMPORTANT: Use the mouse to left-click on the stance box to write down commands.

(Using > before commands is optional, if a command somehow doesn't work, try using it)

>Fight

During a fight, you have to click on words related to violence to hurt the enemy. In theory, these words are what the character/player speaks out to hurt the enemy.

But fighting is not the only solution.

>Gesture

Gestures are another way to handle enemies without fighting and can be accessed by >gesture. Different gesture commands can be entered through the stance: gesture bar. These gestures help to increase your befriending chances essentially, after enough tries you can end battles peacefully by befriending the enemy through the >befriend command.

>Goods

Goods are where you have your items. Mostly food. Food items can be consumed, or shared with the enemy. The enemy will take the item and appreciate this kind gesture, also increasing your chances of befriending enemies.

**To Consume/Share Items you need to use the prefix first and then the item name. Something like;

[prefix] (space) apple/item name here

Be sure to give [space] between the two words for the command to work!

>Run

Gives you a chance to escape battles. (Screen might freeze after you escape the battle, you might need to refresh the page for that)

>befriend

When Enemies are fond of you, they become reluctant to fight and leave them open and unwilling to fight, Allowing you to befriend or ͏k̴̡͖̭̜̙̠̙̩̻̰̜͔̩̦̞͙͕̥͙͉̯̪̝̝̞̪̽́̆̈́̅̏̇͆͜͝͏ḯ̶̢̛͚̖̙̮̝͇̰̭̱͉̬͉͈͔̞̩͉̰͍͇̃͐̋͂̀̎̒̕͘͜ͅ͏l̴̥̳͚̽̓̅̊̆͆͝͏ļ̴̭̣̠̫̳̩̯̠̻͍̻̺̭̭̮̦̰̱̣̤̉̏̃̉̇̔͒̇̅̆͆̐̏̈̈́̿̓̈́̓͗̑̀̔̿̕͜͜͜ ̴͍̭̭̻͋̽̓͋̒̿̄̒̑̔̆̔̏͝͏t̸̡̛̛̛͚̺͖͍̘̣͚͇͈̉̍͆̇̏͆̑̒̂̀́̇̃̓̎̊̿̈́͒̎͐̎̕̕̚ͅͅ͏h̸̢̖̞͎̙̭̬̜͓̬̗͓̘͇̿̒̾̈́͜͜ͅ͏ȩ̶̤͎̝͙̫͌͑̍͋̓̍̒̌̂̽̔̌͘͜͝͏ṃ̵̢̧̮̭̬̖͓͈͇͙̗͓̭͎͙̩̳̳̙͗́̋͌̄͌̈͌̈́̒̈́̍͊͊̆̕̕̕͝͝͝ͅͅ

There might be a lot of bugs and issues that I have overlooked. This is my first major game and I am not a very experienced programmer. I'm sorry.  Also, there are 5 different ways of ending battles, it's up to you to find them!
